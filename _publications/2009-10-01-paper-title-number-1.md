Despite being a promising area of exploration, the application of embedded systems in blockchain technology, particularly with FPGA or Raspberry Pi platforms, remains limited. This paper presents the implementation of a blockchain application specifically tailored for the STM32 platform. By leveraging the STM32 microcontrollerâ€™s capabilities, we demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of embedded systems in blockchain, overcoming limitations observed with previous platforms.
