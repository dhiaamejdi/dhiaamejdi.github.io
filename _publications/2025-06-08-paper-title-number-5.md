We present a conceptual architecture for building trustworthy, self-adaptive ETL pipelines augmented by LLMs. Our system uses modular, stage-specific agents for schema inference, transformation, feature engineering, and cleaning—each with an “LLM-as-a-Checker” validator. A feedback loop aggregates corrections into a shared knowledge base for continuous improvement. A human-in-the-loop mechanism ensures final semantic and business-rule alignment. This framework lays the foundation for adaptive, explainable, and reliable ETL pipelines bridging AI automation and domain expertise.
