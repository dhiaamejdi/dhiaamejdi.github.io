This paper presents a novel multi-modal deep learning framework for social user profiling that combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to enhance advertisement recommendation systems. Our approach integrates CNNs for visual content analysis with advanced NLP models, including TunBERT for Arabic dialect processing, to create comprehensive user profiles. The system employs web scraping to gather social media data and uses Firebase and MongoDB for scalable management. Through the integration of RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, our framework improves user profiling accuracy over traditional demographic approaches, addressing the cultural and linguistic nuances of Arabic-speaking markets.
