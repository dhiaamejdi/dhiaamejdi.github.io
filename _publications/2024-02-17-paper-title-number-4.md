This project integrates a Deep Neural Network for product identification, chemical component prediction, and spectra dimensional reduction in beverage manufacturing. The system leverages PCA for UV to VIS spectra analysis, enhancing process control and product quality in an Industry 4.0 environment. The work includes data understanding, DNN model design, evaluation metrics, and practical insights for digitized manufacturing.
